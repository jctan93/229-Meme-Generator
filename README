NAME: JIAN CHERN TAN  NETID: jctan93

I used a struct called "simp" to store the data for an image, it has these members:
-TWO integer values to store the width and height
-A 2d array of pixels

Pixel is a struct containing 4 "unsigned char" values to store RGBA.

The methods to initialize a pixel and a simp are in simp.c
For pixel: 4 unsigned chars are passed in to be stored and a pixel is returned
For simp : width and height are passed in and the pixel array is malloced


IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION: I'm assuming that any simp file converted with
bmp2simp has enough data valuesto match the width and the height, eg. i'm assuming that
the images aren't corrupted.


FILES ARE LISTED BELOW:

simp.h:
pixel and simp structs are defined here

simp.c:
-The methods to initialize a simp and a pixel are in here, there are also methods
to write to a binary file, to copy an image from a binary file and to free a simp
structure
REVISION FOR 1B: overlay and crop methods were added to be used in 1B, but i didn't modify my 1A code to use them

crop.c:
- Used to crop an image with the values specified in the argument
- If not enough values are specified, an error message is printed and -1 is returned
- If a value that is out of bounds is entered, an error message is printed and -1 is returned

bw.c

colorshift.c:
- Lowercase and uppercase letters are both accepted
anything that isn't a variation of the specified commands for a colorshift results 
in an error message being displayed and -1 is returned


overlay.c
-If the start position is out of bounds, an error message is printed and nothing is done

----------------------------------
PART B

meme.c
- IT takes 2 parameters, the first is the mem file and the second is the act file
- Assumptions: I'm assuming that there aren't any missing letters in the *insertfontnamehere*.fsf
- I'm also assuming that there aren't any missing letters in the font simp image
- If there isn't anything found in the memes.mem file (first value in my internal array is NULL), the program will exit
- The same goes for the act file,(first value in my internal array is NULL), the program will exit
- If nothing is found in the fsf file, the program exits
- If any of the simp files(image/font) fail to open, the program will exit



ALL PROGRAMS RETURN 0 IF AN ERROR OCCURS, EG IF NOT ENOUGH ARGUMENTS ARE SPECIFIED
